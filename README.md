# SDL2 Game Engine

This is a game engine created in C using SDL2 to easily build portable 2D games. It handles sprite animations and action management; tilemap generation using sprites, images, and blank tiles; collision detection with action and animation support; easy configuration using a config file parser. **Rigid body physics engine coming soon**.
